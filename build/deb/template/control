Description: Configure, launch, and work in Dockerized environments
 Containerization is awesome, but the upfront costs of project setup and steep
 learning curve can make it a pain. Ahab is a CLI tool that jump-starts this
 process, avoiding frustration without obfuscating your workflow.
 .
 Ahab searches for a project config file ahab.json and uses it to create and 
 interact with Docker containers. The Ahab CLI supports all of Docker's
 container commands without having to manually target your container name or
 ID.
